## Hey! üëã My name's Caleb

**Looks like you've found my little corner of cyberspace üí´**

![Any chance this is AI generated?](spaceme2.webp)

I'm currently based in [Brisbane, Queensland, Australia](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=brisbane+queensland+australia&t=vivaldi&atb=v389-1&iaxm=directions&end=Brisbane&transport=walking).

**I'm a:**

- üë® Dad
- üë´ Husband
- ‚úù  Son
- ü§ì IT Professional
- üíæ Software Developer
- üîê Cybersecurity Student
- üìΩ Video Veteran
- üé∂ Musician
- ‚úç Writer

### By day, I work as an *IT Systems Desktop Engineer*

I work in education. As part of a close-knit team, I trade hats in technical support (walk-ins, onsite and remote), but officially I **Manage Company Endpoints**.
(I'm not allowed to use the term SOE anymore üòÖ).

When there's time, I like to develop automation workflows to *Work Smarter Not Harder* and make custom processes *easier*.

My close friendship with the system administrator at work affords me the luxury of tinkering with an enterprise grade Proxmox cluster üë®‚Äçüè≠.
Inevitably, Linux, Docker, LXC, VMs, ZFS and high availability are conversational staples. Likely you'll see some related ramblings here!

### By night, I work on projects

üëê **Open-source** 
- I'm passionate about open-source. 
- I contribute where I can and maintain some popular-ish open-source projects myself.

üêß **Linux** 
- I've been a Linux enthusiast since 2009
- I first installed *Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope* inspired by my Dad's 90's guide to RedHat Linux.

üêç **Software Dev**
- Long-time [Python](https://www.python.org) programmer
- Enjoy PowerShell more than I was expecting to üò¨
- Know enough Javascript and webdev to be dangerous üöß
- Going headstrong into [Go](https://go.dev) is probably a good next step 
- Keen to get more into functional programming ([Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), [Gleam](https://gleam.run))
- Have a healthy fear of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) ü¶Ä
- Long-time [Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast) listener üéô


‚òÅ **Self-hosting** 
- I'm a long-time homelabber! 
- Started with a Raspberry Pi 4 2GB
- Use Proxmox, Ubuntu, DietPi, TrueNAS, Ansible
- Proxmox on: `Ryzen 5 5500 + 24TiB ZFS ZRAID2 + ancient (literally rusty) GTX 680` living on my kitchen fridge
- DietPi on: `Raspberry Pi 4GB + MergerFS + Crucial MX500 SSDs`
- Docker, LXC, VMs
- I also have a fleet of various Raspberry Pi's
- I ‚ô• Cloudflare & Tailscale.

‚ö° **Workflow automation** 
- I love working on tooling to automate workflows.
- My love for automation started with [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com)
- Especially robust, long runnin-tasks
- Performant distributed computing makes me happy (when it works) ‚ö°

üì° **Decentralised Comms:** 
- [LoRa is awesome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa)! I have some cheeky TTGO T-Beam LoRa capable radios
- I enjoy hacking on mesh-networking with [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org)
- A fellow mesher and I established a 24KM LOS link between two nodes!

üò∂ **Self-Proclaimed Quirks**
- I'm a pragmatist. Close enough is good enough. 
  - E.g. self-hosting with dependency on Cloudflare
  - "Good artwork is not finished, but abandoned"
- Serial "premature optimisationalist"
  - Need to plan more and code less
  - Like my ducks in a row, often lacking ducks
  - Perfectionism and pragmatism don't go together


**See more details on my projects [here](/projects)!**

#### I ‚ô• anything distributed or decentralised

- Performant distributed computing makes me happy (when it works) ‚ö°
- I enjoy mesh-network hacking on Meshtastic with my cheeky LoRa radios üì°
- Long-live self hosting! Thank you Proxmox, Ubuntu, Cloudflare and Tailscale üíª

#### I am fascinated by AI üëÄ

Long have I lived by the golden rule of automation:

> *"Predictable outputs require consistent inputs"*
>
> ‚Äì Me I guess, but probably others too.

No longer is such advice necessary with the advent of AI.
I've enjoyed implementing cutting-edge AI solutions in automation workflows with LangChain, Flowise and GPTScript that can parse meaningful context from the worst inputs. Not a humble-brag... All thanks to the shoulders of giants before me.

With a background in film and media, I'm drawn to the fusion of AI and creative expression in arts and interactive media. I love the way that AI is being used to generate and augment audio-visual content for creative expression. While it's a field I don't have as much time for as I used to, I'm always interested to learn more and try my hand at what I can.

#### You too?

I'm always on the look out for opportunities to collaborate with like-minded individuals on cool projects! ‚ú®Ô∏è
